  <h2>Welcome to Murat Toprak&#39;s website</h2>
  <p>This website's main purpose is to note the time about what I was thinking at that year, month or even day.</p>
<p>I will be mainly writing about my main interest areas but I don't guarantee. Also, I will try to write at least one blog post for a month but again I'm not sure if I can continue writing everytime.</p>
<p>I won't be deleting any blog posts and I don't think that I will ever update the content after a specific time. (Style changes are excluded)</p>
<p>One more purpose is to just explain my mind. I don't know why but it feels good to me.</p>
